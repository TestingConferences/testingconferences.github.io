## Best Conferences of 2022

Attending conferences is one of the best ways to keep-up on the latest in software testing and quality and of course connect with your peers in the larger communities. This list only contains conferences, un-conferences and workshops that are specifically for software testing and quality. People should strive to attend other tech conferences as it allows us to become better informed and more well rounded.

Attending conferences this year is a bit different than in the past few years, because we're starting to see a new normal. Some in-person conferences are returning safely but there's still a lot of focus on online conferences and how to do them well.

Even attendees are rethinking how they prefer to attend. 

1. Some have given up on in-person because they don't want to take the time and expenditure to attend something in person. They enjoy the flexibility they get from online conferences.
2. Others enjoy the discussion and conferring aspect too much to go entirely online. They'd rather spend the time and be in person. 

Maybe this had best be split into 2 going forward? In the meantime we shall see.
