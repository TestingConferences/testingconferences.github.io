## About This

After keeping track of most software testing conferences and workshops happening around the world, I'm curious as to what conferences and workshops are available online across the general software technology landscape. These could include vendor specific conferences, DevOps, Software Development, AI, etc. etc. If this list turns out to be useful, I could see splitting it off into it's own thing. 

As with our main list of [Current Conferences](/), this list will be regularly updated!
