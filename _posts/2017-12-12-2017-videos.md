In our list of <a href="/past" target="_blank">Past Conferences</a>, when available, we provide a link to testing conference videos that are made available freely online under the link **Event Videos** (open the page and do a quick search).

We think there's an *amazing community benefit* when events record their presentations (or at least some of them) and distribute them freely on the web. We know this adds to the cost of producing and coordinating a conference because you need to equipment, transportation and personnel to do these things. As a way to highlight those conferences, promote this idea and say **Thank You** here are the 2017 software testing conferences with video recordings in *alphabetical order*:

**Other Things**

- Compared to the 10 or more events recorded in 2016, 2017 wasn't as good for free videos. CAST didn't record anything, Let's Test hasn't posted anything and there was no GTAC.
