The following is a list of [LAWST](http://lawst.com/)-style workshops from around the world. Some of these are active and others aren't. If you find any missing from this list please feel free to add to it.

LAWST or the Los Altos Workshops on Software Testing and is a meeting based on:

_Attendance is by application or invitation, and limited to 15-20 participants. Instead of several topics which are only glanced at, a LAWST conference has only 2 or 3 very specific topics, with the goal being to work on at least one thoroughly. Discussion does not end until the group is satisfied. Attendees are highly encouraged to challenge the results of the presenter, who must defend the work being presented. After discussion, specific statements are collected and voted upon. These statements will probably be published, and belong to everyone in the group._ [credit: LAWST homepage](http://lawst.com/)
