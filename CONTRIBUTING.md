# Contributing to testingconferences.org

First off, thank you for considering contributing! It’s people like you who keep this list accurate and useful for the testing community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Adding a New Conference
The most common way to help is by adding a conference that isn't on the list yet or updating one that is. 
- Search the current list to make sure it isn't already there.
- Open a Pull Request (PR) adding the conference to the relevant data file.
- Ensure you follow our data schema (see the `README.md` for field requirements).

### 2. Reporting an Issue
If you find a broken link, an incorrect date, or a bug on the site:
- **Check the Footer:** Find the **Site Version** in the footer of the website.
- **Open an Issue:** Include the version number and a description of the error.

### 3. Improving the Site (DX/Quality)
We are currently working through our [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) to improve site quality and developer experience. If you want to help with Lighthouse scores, build scripts, or automation, please check the roadmap for "Open" tasks.
