**Sponsoring Us**

As we look for ways to maintain and build out the project we think allowing limited sponsorships makes sense. This will
allow us to bring in other people (professionals) to help design and make the site better over all.

**What comes with Sponsorship?**

Sponsors get promotion through banner across the top of this site and mention in our monthly newsletter. It's. that.
simple.

**Pricing**

Pricing is based on the per thousand sessions for your given month and depends on availability. Therefore pricing can
change month to month and year to year as traffic grows. We do offer multi-month purchasing discounts.
